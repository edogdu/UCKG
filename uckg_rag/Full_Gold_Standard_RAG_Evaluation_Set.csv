18,CWE,What’s the difference between CWE-285 and CWE-287?,"CWE-285 is Improper Authorization, where access control is not correctly enforced, while CWE-287 is Improper Authentication, where the identity of users is not verified. The former governs what users can do, the latter governs who they are."
19,CWE,Which CWE is associated with race conditions in file access?,"CWE-362 covers race conditions like Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU), where the state of a resource changes between check and use. This can allow attackers to manipulate file or memory state unexpectedly."
20,CWE,What weakness is CWE-416 and why is it dangerous?,"CWE-416 refers to Use After Free, where a program continues to use memory after it has been released. This can lead to crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution."
21,General,What are the vulnerabilities associated with OpenBSD?,"OpenBSD has been affected by vulnerabilities such as format string issues in su and ssh, and denial of service via kernel panic through ipintr() and ipq. These map to weaknesses like CWE-134 and CWE-400."
